# Harvest API v2 Samples

Check out the code samples in this repository to quickly get started with
Harvest in your favorite language. If you have a sample for a language we're
missing, feel free to fork and give us a pull request. We'd love to add more
samples!

## Getting Started

In order to run any of the samples, you'll first need to obtain an access token
and account ID from Harvest ID.

### Setting Environment Variables

#### MacOS

```
export HARVEST_ACCOUNT_ID=<Your Harvest account ID>
export HARVEST_ACCESS_TOKEN=<Your Harvest access token>
```

For example, if your access token is "foobar123" and your account ID is
"987654", then you'll want to:

```
export HARVEST_ACCOUNT_ID=foobar123
export HARVEST_ACCESS_TOKEN=987654
```

#### Windows

```
set HARVEST_ACCOUNT_ID=<Your Harvest account ID>
set HARVEST_ACCESS_TOKEN=<Your Harvest access token>
```

For example, if your access token is "foobar123" and your account ID is
"987654", then you'll want to:

```
set HARVEST_ACCOUNT_ID=foobar123
set HARVEST_ACCESS_TOKEN=987654
```
